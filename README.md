## О коде:
Всё разбито на функции (каждая из которых задокументирована), а также показано множество разных возможностей (которым мы научились на занятиях), использование обширного количества доступных нам методов, операторов, типов данных и т.д.

## Пример взаимодействия (terminal):

Please, write norm numbers, because program dosn't have checks for human...

Put first base for trapezoid: 12
Put second base for trapezoid: 7
Put high for trapezoid: 4
I think, that 38 is square of your trapezoid

Task №1 is done, let's start №2?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put radius and I`l init circle: 4.89
Your circle params:
square = 150.168
lengh = 30.7092

Task №2 is done, let's start №3?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put first katet for triangle that has 90' angle: 3
Put second katet for triangle that has 90' angle: 4
So, square of this triagle = 6 and hypotenuse is 5

Task №3 is done, let's start №4?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put four-diget number and I'l return sum: 5362.012
So easy for me and sum is 16

Task №4 is done, let's start №5?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Write 'x' value in decart system: 4
Write 'y' value in decart system: 4
Inputted coords in polar system: (5.65685, 0.785398)

Task №5 is done, let's start №6?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 1

Write 'x' value in polar system: 4
Write 'y' value in polar system: 1
Inputted coords in decard system: (2.16121, 3.36588)

Task №6 is done, let's start №7?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put value that stay before 'x' in quadratic equation (YOUR_VALUE * x +- ... * x^2 +- ...): 5
Put value that stay before 'x^2' in quadratic equation (5x YOUR_VALUE * x^2 +- ...): 3
Put 'c' value that stay in the end in quadratic equation (5x + 3x^2 YOUR_VALUE): -26
Roots of a quadratic equation '5x + 3x^2 + -26':
X1 = 2 & X2 = -2.6

Task №7 is done, let's start №8?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Write 'a' side in triangle: 5
Write 'b' side in triangle: 7
Write 'c' side in triangle: 4
If we try to make new triangle with sides that equal medians in your triangle, we will get something like this:
Side A: 5.12348 & Median to this side: 3.75
Side B: 2.87228 & Median to this side: 5.25
Side C: 5.74456 & Median to this side: 3

Task №8 is done, let's start №9?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put number of secs that spent after start of day: 1234
Oh, I tried to convert it and get this: 00:20

Task №9 is done, let's start №10?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Input triangle's first side: 4
Input triangle's second side: 4
Input triangle's third side: 4
Your triangle (with all sides = 4) is isoscales!

Task №10 is done, let's start №11?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Please, say me your private info about sum that you spend for bying something: 17234.2348
With sale 10%, this sum are 15510.8

Task №11 is done, let's start №12?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Write someone's weigth: 80
Write someone's hight: 182
Program thinks that someone should eat more and make weigth bigger to 82

Task №12 is done, let's start №13?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

I have generated some num (0, 9), try to guess: 1
Wow, it isn't right, becouse I generated 3 ;(

Task №13 is done, let's start №14?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put lengh of speking (in hours): 3.5
Put num of day, when speking (0, 7): 7
Price for tolking (per hour = 1000) is 2800. So, think about it...

Task №14 is done, let's start №15?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put number of month (1, 12): 10
I found, that month October is in Autumn

Task №15 is done, let's start №16?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put six-count number and I'l say is num lycky: 123300
No, it isn't...

Task №16 is done, let's start №17?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put score of kopeika: 69
I think, that 69 sounds with копеек

Task №17 is done, let's start №18?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put four-count number: 1221
It is polindrom

Task №18 is done, let's start №19?
press ENTER to continue or 'stop' to break process: 

Put 3-count number: 945
Put param 'b' to look with 3-count num's product: 8844
